Over the course of three months, I learned the basics of creating Android applications using Kotlin and Android Studio. Shortly after, I secured a position as a Lead Software Engineer Intern at TheraMotive, a startup based in Brooklyn. There, I led a team of 10+ interns in designing and developing a company dashboard using Next.js, React.js, and MongoDB.",
  "I am currently completing my final classes at Queens College, with plans to graduate in December 2025. Alongside my studies, I am participating in CodePath's Technical Interview Prep course from February to April to prepare for technical interviews, while also planning and building a new full-stack application that combines my skills and passion for software development into an impactful project.",
